# DevOps Configurations

This directory contains all the DevOps configurations for your system, organized by tool/level.

## 📂 Structure

- **docker/**: Level 1 - Docker Compose files
- **k8s/**: Level 2 - Kubernetes manifests
- **helm/**: Level 3 - Helm charts
- **monitoring/**: Level 4 - Prometheus & Grafana configs
- **argocd/**: Levels 2-5 - GitOps configurations

## 🎓 How to Use

As you progress through the levels, you will copy files from the `level-X/helper/` folders into these directories.

For example, in Level 2, you will copy Kubernetes manifests into `devops/k8s/`.
