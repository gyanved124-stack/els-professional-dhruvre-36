# ⚠️ This is a placeholder file

Students should copy actual workflow files from the helper folders:

- **Level 1**: Copy `level-1/helper/.github/workflows/docker-build.yml` to this directory

This file ensures the `.github/workflows/` directory is tracked in Git.

After copying the workflow file, you can delete this placeholder.
